## Prerequisites
### This tutorial assumes that you:

* Have a solid understanding of both Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)
* Have a least an intermediate understanding of JavaScript (I should not have to explain what an object is or the basics of DOM manipulation, though for some of the more advanced stuff, I will be giving _brief_ explainations and providing links to documentation)
* Know enough about Git and Github to be able to either clone or fork this repo. Hey, if all else fails, just copy and paste the darn files.
