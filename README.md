# Pixel Art Maker Tutorial - Using HTML5 Canvas

Hello and welcome to my  pixel art maker tutorial. This was my final project for the Grow with Google Scholarship Program. By the end of this tutorial, you will have made a pixel art maker that looks something like [this](https://arhillis.github.io/pixelArt.html). So, clone this repo and let's get started!

## Prerequisites
### This tutorial assumes that you:

* Have a solid understanding of both Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)
* Have a least an intermediate understanding of JavaScript (I should not have to explain what an object is or the basics of DOM manipulation, though for some of the more advanced stuff, I will be giving _brief_ explainations and providing links to documentation)
